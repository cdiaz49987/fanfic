      <h1> The Break Up <h1>
        <p> Slam* jungkooks hand up against the wall behind me

I look up and see jungkook all serious


His eyebrows nearly touching each other.

"Why did you accept Min yoongi's confession"

"Ummm... because" I stutter.

Slam*

"Don't give me excuses. I know you love me so why did you go and accept it"

"Because I love him not you" I lied.


"Wrong"

Slam*

"I can tell, the way you look at me says everything"

I froze I did want him to find out I still have feelings for him. I don't want to be trapped in this unhealthy relationship.

"But all that doesn't matter, we broke up! I have nothing to do with you! You were the one who cheated in the first place!"

"You know.. you know I didn't have a choice. My friend was in a desperate situations I just..." Jungkook holds back his words feeling regretful.

"Shut up!"

His eyes widen.

"Please I don't want to be with you. Please let me be" I sob.

Jongkook's face was in shock because I started crying out of the blue but I couldn't hold back the tears.

"Is this really it. After all I did for you"

"Jungkook please don't do this" I beg.

"After I gave up my career just to be with you this how you treat me"

"Jungkook"

"Fine. I'm glad I cheated on you, to see who you really are"



"Jungkook"

"Bye Anilu"</p>
